# VanillaTweaks_CompabilityFix
This pack adds compability between many VanillaTweaks-packs, that are normally incompatible with each other. This project is still work in progress.

## Which packs do I need to install, to have <PACK_X> and <PACK_Y> together?
In the releases tab, the packs are named <PACK_X>_<PACK_Y>Fix. You have to install <PACK_Y> from the [VanillaTweaks-Website](https://www.vanillatweaks.net) and put it BLOW the pack, you have downloaded here.
